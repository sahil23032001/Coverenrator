Dear {hiring_manager},

I am writing to express my interest in the {job_title} position at {company_name}, as advertised on {platform}. With over three years of experience at Willis Towers Watson as a Senior Actuarial Analyst, I bring a solid foundation in pension valuation, regulatory reporting, and actuarial modeling across diverse markets including the US and China.

In my current role, I‚Äôve managed valuations for over 15 Defined Benefit pension plans, ensured 100% compliance in government reporting (Form 5500, Schedule SB), and mentored junior analysts on both data and regulatory processes. Having cleared four IFOA exams (CM1, CS1, CB1, CB2) and developed strong technical skills in Excel and R, I am now looking to broaden my exposure to life and general insurance through dynamic consultancy work.

I am particularly drawn to {company_name}'s reputation for {company_value}, which aligns with my own drive to grow within a forward-thinking actuarial environment.

I have attached my resume for your review and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Best regards,  
Vratika Jodhani
